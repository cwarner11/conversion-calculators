### Specification:

In conversion.py, the user is prompted to enter their weight that is formatted into a float. If the user enters a weight less than zero, it throws an error message and requires them to renter a weight greater than zero. After entering a valid weight, the user is asked if the float they entered in pounds(lbs) or kilograms(kg). When they correctly enter their initial unit of weight, the program converts it to the option not used and prints it out to the screen.
